Need to write a couple of functions.



function: computerSelection
  get r/p/s for computer at random
    get a random number from 1-999, inclusive
    modulo 3 to get a number 0-2
    if 0, return rock
    if 1, return paper
    else (2), return scissors

function: playerSelection
  get rock/paper/scissors input from user
    prompt, and then store value in variable, after .toLowerCase

main function should prompt the user for an odd number of games to play

then simulate that many games of RPS
several counters:
  computerWin
  playerWin
  gamesPlayed



Each game:

play the round
  call playerSelection
  call computerSelection
  compare the two values of playerSelection and computerSelection
    three possibilities, tie, computerWin, playerWin
    if playerSelection === computerSelection
      tie
    if playerSelection is rock && computerSelection is scissors OR
    if playerSelection is scissors && computerSelection is paper OR
    if playerSelection is paper && computerSelection is rock
      player wins
    else
      computer wins
  return tie, computerWin, playerWin

if it's a tie, 
  play another game 
repeat until someone wins

add 1 to winCount of whoever winCount
repeat if not the last game



at the very end
compare winCounts and console.log the winner
